### Hi! I'm Dave Kiss, and I make the internet. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working full-time with [Mux](https://mux.com)
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning about WebRTC, TypeScript, public speaking, and being a father
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

I had a pretty early start on this web stuff â€“ I still remember the modem connection sounds of AOL 2.5 emanating from my eMachines desktop like it was yesterday. My first website was a [Kool-aid fan site](http://angelfire.com/oh5/koolaid) that I built in 2004 (yeah, itâ€™s still up.)

However, it was 1995â€™s Spider-Man Cartoon Maker that was the real catalyst for pursuing my first dream of being a world class video producer.

For years, I was laser-focused on being one of the best videographers out there. I went to university to study digital media production. While I was there, I had to make a portfolio website to display my videos on and realized that I really enjoyed the challenge that building a professional website presented.

In 2011, I moved to Chicago and started working with a small 3D animation studio called [Greyscalegorilla](https://greyscalegorilla.com). We needed a way to showcase some videos on the companyâ€™s website, so I researched some options and wasnâ€™t able to find a great solution. So I did what I always do in that kind of situation â€“ come up with my own way to make it work.

Rather than building a tool that only worked for us, I thought itâ€™d be a good fit for other companies that faced a similar task. With permission, I open-sourced the code and assigned a price tag to some of the more complicated features.

In 2012, I started [selling my own software online](https://vimeography.com) and took a few years to grow the sales to a sustainable level. I did it by extracting my truth from the industryâ€™s smartest brains, applying it to my ideas along the way, and finding out firsthand what did and didnâ€™t work.

For 8 years, that was my full time job. The autonomy and creativity was unparalleled, and it provided the opportunity to explore my many other interests. However, working for myself became a little lonely at times, and doubly so during a pandemic.

In September 2021, I decided to combine my video production background, web dev chops, and passion for community into a neat little package and roll into a Community Engineering role with the fine team at [Mux.](https://mux.com)

I get a ton of satisfaction from sharing what I know. Whether itâ€™s helping you write your first few lines of Javascript, making your first online sale, or talking about the importance of meetups, I want to do my best to help you do better work and share what Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

- I value **autonomy**; my time is extremely important to me.
- I want to take **ownership** of the things that I make. I did not get in to creative work just to crank out work for someone else.
- I want to **learn** about the things that I care about the most â€“ not the rigid requirements of what only makes someone else happy.
- I want more out of my life than sitting predictably at my office desk every day. I want to **push, encounter new situations, and explore**.
- I want to **have input** on what I should work on for the day. I donâ€™t want to just rent out my brain space for someone elseâ€™s agenda.
- I want to **collaborate** with others who are just as passionate about working as I am.
- I believe in **listening to my body and my mind**. If Iâ€™m not feeling like Iâ€™m putting out strong work, I should stop and come back when Iâ€™m ready. _I donâ€™t want to be made to feel bad for taking workdays off._
- I believe in the importance of **remote work**, and I prioritize my work environment over a predictable commute and cubicle.
- I enjoy applying all of the **ideas and inspiration** that surround me to a project of my own.
- I believe that the time I spend working is, at best, indirectly related to the **value of the things that I create**.
